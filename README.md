ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alfie1906, a freelance data scientist working primarily on the website Upwork.com

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R and SQL - I code mainly in Python but I definitely still have a lot of room for improvement in that area too!

ðŸ“« How to reach me - feel free to drop me a message on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfie-grace-b285ab161/

You can also find me on LearnDataSci - an online platform targeted at aspiring and current data scientists - where I write content for the solutions segment of the website @ https://www.learndatasci.com/author/AlfieGrace

The biggest project I'm working on right now is assisting with the ETL process at Fresh Grease, a startup that aims to revolutionize the way people shop for bicycles. Find them @ https://www.freshgrease.com/
