ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alfie1906, a Snr. Data Scientist working at Square Enix - a video game publisher. As a result, I've worked with data for some cool IPs, such as Final Fantasy, Avengers, and Tomb Raider! I specialize in machine learning operations, recommender systems, and natural language processing, and I love the associated challenges of working with large datasets.

ðŸŒ± I code in Python & SQL, and have spent a lot of time improving my engineering skills, with a particular focus on bringing this all together in a Google Cloud environment. My current focus is to continue upskilling in recommender systems, looking at how deep learning can be used to improve performance. I'm also a big fan of generative AI, and I'm in the process of trying to figure out ways to use this technology for data collection/enrichment.

ðŸ“« How to reach me - feel free to drop me a message on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfie-grace-b285ab161/). I'm always looking for exciting projects I can involve myself in, so let me know if you've got something you think I'd be interested in!

You can also find me [here](https://www.learndatasci.com/author/AlfieGrace) on LearnDataSci - an online platform targeted at aspiring and current data scientists - where I've written content for the Python and SQL solutions segments of the website.
