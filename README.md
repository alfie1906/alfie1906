ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alfie1906, a data scientist working at Square Enix - a video game publisher. As a result, I've worked with data for some cool IPs, such as Final Fantasy, Avengers and Tomb Raider!

ðŸŒ± I code in Python & SQL, but I'm currently focussing on upskiling my cloud engineering skills, specifically looking at ML engineering on Google Cloud Platform.

ðŸ“« How to reach me - feel free to drop me a message on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfie-grace-b285ab161/. I'm always looking for exciting projects I can involve myself in, so let me know if you've got something you think I'd be interested in!

You can also find me on LearnDataSci - an online platform targeted at aspiring and current data scientists - where I've written content for the Python solutions segment of the website @ https://www.learndatasci.com/author/AlfieGrace
